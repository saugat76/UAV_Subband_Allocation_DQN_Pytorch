C:\Users\tripats\Documents\GitHub\UAV_Subband_Allocation_DQN_Pytorch\contention_env_complex\main.py:160: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
